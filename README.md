## The Mission

Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, is in a bit of a pickle. Indeed, his police department, the NYPD, collected information about all the traffic accidents that happened in New York City. However, they are too busy eating doughnuts to correctly encode each traffic incident, and so it happens that the dataset that we got here is quite dirty, has a lot of missing values and can't be used by a machine learning model as is. Can you help Mr. de Blasio and shine a new light on his police department ?

What he wants exactly is to predict which streets are the most dangerous while visiting the city that never sleeps.

I am sure that you are well-equipped to handle this.
